# JavaScript Portfolio Website 🚀

**Built with GitHub Codespaces, React & GitHub Copilot**

This repository contains my personal portfolio website built using a React-based JavaScript template and developed entirely in GitHub Codespaces. The project demonstrates how modern web applications can be created, customized, and deployed using only a web browser—no local setup required.
